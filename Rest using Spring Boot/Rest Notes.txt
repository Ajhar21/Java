***************************** REST *****************************

V-234 what is REST
* REST stands for representational state transfer
* State -> transfering current state between client & server. ex:current employeer
* REST API -> used for transferring state. two famous way of communication between client-server. 1. JSON 2. XML
* JSON -> Stands for Javascript Object Notation, takes less memory. Easier to understand
* every request to server is stateless
*** for API url we don't use verb, use noun

V-235 Http Methods
* GET,POST,PUT,DELETE are Http methods
* GetMapping,PostMapping,PutMapping,DeleteMapping are springboot annotations for mapping request

V-236 Understanding React UI
* read the Understanding React UI for understanding configuration

V-237 Working with Postman

V-238 Creating a Rest Controller

V-239 Connecting React and Spring
* use annotation with attribute in controller under @RestController-> @CrossOrigin(origins = "http://localhost:3000")
->here http://localhost:3000 is the React frontend
* add api url http://localhost:8080/api/job/posts in Search method of file Search.jsx

V-240 Path Variable
* Example
@GetMapping("/jobPost/{jobId}")
public JobPost getJob(@PathVariable("jobId") int jobId){
	return service.getJob(jobId);
}

V-241 Sending Data and RequestBody
* public JobPost addJobPost(@RequestBody JobPost jobPost, here request body annotoation used to send request client from server

V-242 Put and Delete Mapping
* @PutMapping("/jobPost")
    public JobPost updateJob(@RequestBody JobPost jobPost)
* @DeleteMapping("/jobPost/{jobId}")
    public String deleteJob(@PathVariable("jobId") int jobId)

V-243 Content Negotiation
* jackson library is responsible for converting json or xml to java object(deserialization)
* jackson by dafault work with json, spring boot by default have this library
* from mvnrepository needs to inject dependency for xml, must me same version as project jackson version
* we can negotiate content in method level for each rest request
* key: Accept Value:application/xml	for accepting xml in get
* key: Content-Type Value:application/json for sending json data to server(post,put,delete)
* key: Content-Type Value:application/xml for sending xml data to server(post,put,delete)
* @GetMapping(path="/jobPosts",produces = "application/xml") produces only xml format to client
* @PostMapping(path="/jobPost",consumes="application/json")   only consume json format
