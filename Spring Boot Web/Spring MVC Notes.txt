************* Spring MVC notes ***************

View technologies
JSP -> Jakarta Server Pages(Formerly Java Server Pages)

MVC ->Model, View, Controller
here Servlet works as controller,
JSP works as View,
POJO(Plain Old Java Object) works as Model
***behind the scene, JSP gets converted to servlet. Tomcat works as servlet container.

Client-> Controller(Servlet) -> Model(POJO) -> View(JSP) -> Client
